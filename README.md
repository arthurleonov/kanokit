# Kanso HTML/CSS Bootstrap UI Kit

Hello there, designers are spoiled with UI kits that they can use, reuse and modify to their needs. What if there was UI kit for front-end developers. I created Kanso UI Kit for speed up my website building workflow to reuse most common elements. I found that I saved me a lot of time and I hope it will be usefull to everyone too. Let me walk you though it.


FAQ
--------------

**How do I use it?**

1. Open your terminal and type in:
```
& git clone https://github.com/arthurleonov/kansokit

```
2. Alternatively you can use the [codepen demo](http://codepen.io/arthurleonov/full/dMpXVM/). Below the element you will find two buttons "Show HTML" & "Link to SCSS file". I made it so a person could take the needed code and proceed as fast as possible.

**What are these funny css classes?**

The css is written in BEM. I wanted to make it very modular and responsive so that if you drop it any context it should just work with minimal effort. If you are not familiar with BEM
        I highly recommend reading about it [here](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-the-bem-methodology--cms-19403) or watching about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKFq2cSbQ4Q)

**Is Foundation version coming soon?**

Yes it is coming shortly.
